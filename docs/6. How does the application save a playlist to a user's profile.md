# 6. How does the application save a playlist to a user's profile? 

To save the playlist to Spotify we will have to do a POST request containing the song, artist and album of all tracks on the playlist to be added as a playlist of the Spotify user.

How to create a playlist through the Spotify API is found at the documentation of the create-playlist endpoint. 

Endpoint:
POST https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/{user_id}/playlists

How to use it: 
POST "https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/thelinmichael/playlists" -H "Authorization: Bearer {your access token}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"name\":\"A New Playlist\", \"public\":false}"

This will add a playlist with name ‘A new Playlist’.

Who the user is can be obtained by another request :
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me

How to use it:
GET "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me" -H "Authorization: Bearer {your access token}"

and then from the jsonResponse object retrieve the property ’id’

To add tracks to the new playlist you might add them directly to the above POST request I guess, like 
```
--data "{
  \"name\":\"A New Playlist\", 
  \"public\":false,
  \”tracks\”: {
    \”items\”: [ ] 
  }
}"
```
putting the tracks in there. How to do that is also described . The content of the items array would look like:
```
{ 
  added_at: ,
  aded_by: ,
  is_local: false,
  track: {
    album: { },
    artists: [ {
        external_urls: ,
        href: ,
        id: , 
        name: , 
        type: , 
        uri: 
      }, ... 
    ],
    name: \“songname\”
    type: \”track\”
  }
}
```

To find what to put exactly where, see the complete list of Objects of the Spotify API.
