# 1. What components does the app need?
Looking at the layout of the app-screen I would say:
* App
* SearchBar
* Results
* Playlist
* ResultsSong
* PlaylistSong

with super classes:
* Song
* SongList

Results and Playlist may be extended from a super class SongList, The items in both lists (ResultsSong and PlaylistSong) may be extended from a super class Song.
 
Since I donâ€™t want to deal with (re)writing css and html I will have a look at the supplied code to see what is expected.

After taking a look at the supplied html-file I will use the following component-names:
* App
* SearchBar
* SearchResultTracks
* PlayListTracks
* SearchResultTrackList
* PlayListTrackList
* SearchResultTrack
* PlayListTrack

and as super class for SearchResultTracks and PlayListTracks respectively SearchResultTrack and PlayListTrack:
* Tracks
* Track
