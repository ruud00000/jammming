# 4. How does the application hook up to the Spotify API?

### Register the app at Spotify

The app must be registered at Spotify (needs to be done once only).

My Spotify Developer account: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications
<br />App name: Jammming

### Type of request

As a way of doing requests I intend to follow the steps as provided in [Course Unit 2, Requests 2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-requests/lessons/requests-ii/exercises/requests-intro-ii?action=lesson_resume&program_content_id=720c50d30543383fd8ee82ce13b3ef31&program_id=8e14e567a49f749ac096378873934906) step 12-17. 

Boilerplate code for a GET-request is then:
```
async function getData() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint');
    if (response.ok) {
      let jsonResponse = await response.json();
      return jsonResponse;
    }
    throw new Error('Request failed!');
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

and for a POST-request:
```
async function getData() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({id: 200})                                                       });
    if (response.ok) {
      let jsonResponse = await response.json();
      return jsonResponse;
    }
    throw new Error('Request failed!');    
  }
  catch(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Authorization flow

In the project’s instructions Implicit Grant Flow (see [Course Unit 2, Article Authentication and OAth](https://www.codecademy.com/programs/8e14e567a49f749ac096378873934906/items/42276cdf573c1ac09591a0465853af34), step 9) is used, which doesn’t require the use of a client secret key, so I will stick to that.

The Implicit Grant Flow as implemented by Spotify is as follows  :
![Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Implicit-Grant-Flow-Diagram.png)

The API documentation gives following example request for requesting authorization:
<br />GET https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=5fe01282e94241328a84e7c5cc169164&redirect_uri=http:%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&response_type=token&state=123

However in this project’s description only the required fields (client_id, response_type and redirect_uri) are put in the query, as well as scope:
<br />GET https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI 
<br />So I will stick to that.

Upon sending that request the user will be asked to login to his Spotify-account, if token has expired. 

The Spotify API will then redirect to the redirect_uri (as provided in the request) so for the development server that will be https://localhost:3000 but that will need to be updated when published to the web. A token is sent with this response, that needs to be stored in the program to send along with every next request to the Spotify API. An example of a response will then be: 
<br />https://localhost:3000#access_token=NwAExz...BV3O2Tk&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600&state=123 so ‘access_token’ is the thing to extract from that response-message.

When access is denied the response will look like: https://localhost:3000?error=access_denied&state=123 and then error is the thing we will be looking for.

In the next section I will describe how to use this token to make a query to the Spotify API.

### The authorization request

Using async GET request format, the request for a token would look like:

Boilerplate:
```
async function getData() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint');
    if (response.ok) {
      let jsonResponse = await response.json();
      return jsonResponse;
    }
    throw new Error('Request failed!');
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

Actual code:
```
// data for accessing Spotify API
const clientId = ‘<put client ID here>’;
redirectUri = ‘http://localhost:3000’;
const url = `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=${clientId}&response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}`;
let accessToken;

async function getAccessToken() {
  // copied this snippet from Yelp.js from project Ravenous Part4, but don’t understand this 
  if (accessToken) {
    return new Promise(resolve => resolve(accessToken));
  }
  try {
    let response = await fetch(url);
    if (response.ok) {
      let jsonResponse = await response.json();
      accessToken = jsonResponse.access_token;
      return jsonResponse;
    }
    throw new Error('Request for token failed!');
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```
