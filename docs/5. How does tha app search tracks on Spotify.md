# 5. How does the app search tracks on Spotify?

To do a search on Spotify we will have to do a GET request, providing the search term as a query parameter.

How to do a search through the Spotify API is found at the documentation of the search endpoint.   (https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/) 

Endpoint:
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/search

How to use it:
GET "https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=track&q=TERM" -H "Authorization: Bearer {your access token}"

Since we are asking for track-objects (type=”track”) the response body contains an array of track objects, wrapped in a paging object. 
See https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/object-model/#track-object-simplified for reference.
